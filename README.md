# 🧠 Docker Stress Detector App

The **Docker Stress Detector App** is a neuroscience-inspired machine learning application that detects human stress levels based on brain region activations—specifically the **Prefrontal Cortex**, **Amygdala**, and **Hippocampus**. The app is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy, test, and scale across environments.

## 🔬 Background

Emotional stress is linked to measurable changes in brain activity, particularly in regions such as:

- **Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)** – involved in decision-making and regulation of emotional responses
- **Amygdala** – processes fear and emotional reactivity
- **Hippocampus** – related to memory and contextual processing

By analyzing activation levels in these regions, the model can infer a person's stress or not.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧠 Input: Neural activation data (from EEG/fMRI simulation or dataset)
- 🤖 Stress classification using machine learning
- 📦 Dockerized app for reproducible testing
- 📈 Log results to file or database
